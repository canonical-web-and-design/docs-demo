# Troubleshooting Juju

This section is dedicated to the troubleshooting of Juju when things go wrong.
Make sure you have [Juju installed](./getting-started.html#installation) and
configured correctly.

- [Troubleshooting Juju itself](./troubleshooting-juju.html) - `Coming soon!`
- [Juju logs](./troubleshooting-logs.html)
- [Troubleshooting model upgrades](./troubleshooting-upgrade.html) - help for
upgrading Juju across a model.

If your issue is not addressed here, consider the
[Juju section on askubuntu.com](http://askubuntu.com/search?q=juju).
