# Exposing applications

By design, Juju operates a very secure environment for deploying your 
applications.
Even if you have deployed applications, they won't be publicly available unless
you explicitly make them so. To allow public access to applications, the
appropriate changes must be made to the cloud provider firewall settings. As
the procedure for doing this varies depending on your cloud, Juju helpfully
abstracts this into a single command, `juju expose <applicationname>`.

For example, you may have deployed a WordPress application using the relevant
charm. Once deployed, the application still cannot be accessed by the public,
so you would run:

```bash
juju expose wordpress
```

Juju will then take the steps necessary to adjust firewall rules and any other
settings to expose the application via its given address. This process may take
anything from a few moments to several minutes. You can check on the current
status of your applications by running:

```bash
juju status
```

This will return a status report like this:

```yaml
juju status
[Applications]
NAME       STATUS  EXPOSED CHARM                
mariadb    unknown false   cs:trusty/mariadb-2  
wordpress  unknown true    cs:trusty/wordpress-4

[Relations]

mariadb         wordpress     db           regular
wordpress       wordpress     loadbalancer peer

wordpress/0 unknown        idle        2.0-alpha2 1       80/tcp 54.145.6.196          

[Machines]

2          started 54.224.143.151 i-9626540e trusty us-east-1c 
```

As you can see here under [Applications], the `EXPOSED:` status is listed as 
true, and the application is running and available to users.

**Note:** Exposing the application does not change any DNS or other settings 
which may be necessary to get your application running as you expect.

# Unexposing an application

To return the firewall settings and make an application non-public again, you
simply need to run the `unexpose` command. For example:

```bash
juju unexpose wordpress
```
